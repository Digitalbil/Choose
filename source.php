	<b>The Source</b><br>
	<br>

	So you all want to know how this masterpiece was constructed, right? Right? Well, here's the source for your enjoyment.<br>
	<br>

	The program requires PHP 4 and mysql, though it could easily be adapted to use other databases (or even other languages if you were feeling adventurous).<br>
	<br>
	SVN Repo: <a href="https://svn.iamcal.com/public/www/choose/">https://svn.iamcal.com/public/www/choose/</a><br />
	<br />
	<br />
	It refers to an external database library. I haven't yet published that, so you're somewhat on your own there.
<br /> 
Currently we are running a modified version which is released under the GPL... and we will get the source up and stuff... soon.
